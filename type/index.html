		<p><span class="info">As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.</span></p>

		<p>He saw a trainer nearby and asked <span class="info2">why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away.<p></span> 


		<p><span class="letter3">Well the trainer said, </span></p>

		<div class="a"><span class="other-font">When they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it is enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.</span></div class="a">

		<p><span class="letter4">The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they could not, they were stuck right where they were.</span></p>
