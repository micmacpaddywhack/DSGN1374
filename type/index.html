	<h1> THE ELEPHANT ROPE </h1>
</div>
<body>
	<main>

		<p>As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg.<span class="info"> No chains, no cages.</span> It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.</p>

		<p>He saw a trainer nearby and asked <span class="info">why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away.<p></span> Well the trainer said,  

		<div class="a"><span class="other-font">When they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it is enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.</span></div class="a">

		<p>The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they could not, they were stuck right where they were.</p>
		<p> <span class="important">Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.</span> </p>
		<div class="b"><span class="moral">Moral of the story</span></div class= "b">
		<p>No matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible. Believing you can become successful is the most important step in actually achieving it.</p>
