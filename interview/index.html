				<h3> When I say "graphic designer" what is the first thing that comes to mind? </h3>
			</div>
			<div class="a"> 
				<p> Visual communication </p>
			</div>

			<div class="q"> 
				<h3> What is a graphic designer to you? </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="a"> 
				<p> A graphic designer is someone who needs to convey a message and inform/captivate the audience through physical or virtual art. </p> 
			</div>

			<div class="q"> 
				<h3> What qualities and skills should a good graphic designer have? </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="a"> 
				<p> Imagination. Innovation. A graphic designer should have a creative eye and an understanding of visual communication. Another quality is attention to detail and being current with the latest trends. Time management and organization skills are also very important.   </p> 
			</div>

			<div class="q"> 
				<h3> Are you lacking any of these qualities? </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="a"> 
				<p> One skill that I have always struggled with is my time management. As a graphic design student I find myself scrambling to get all my projects finished on time, and I know when in the field, it will be no different, so hopefully I can learn how to prioritize and schedule my time better. </p> 
			</div>


			<div class="q"> 
				<h3> Describe your creative process. What are the major steps? </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="a"> 
				<p> First I make a coffee.. probably the most important step. Next, I make a list of words and create a mind-map. I add pictures and quick doodles to my mind-map and I use Pinterest and other websites to help for images.</p> 
			</div>

			<div class="q"> 
				<h3> Tell me your best design joke? </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="a"> 
				<p> Roses are #ff0000, violets are #0000FF </p> 
			</div>

			<div class="q"> 
				<h3> What are your plans as a Graphic Designer after you finish school? </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="a"> 
				<p> I haven’t really thought that far ahead, it’s 2020 and I don’t even know what day it is anymore. I still have so much more to learn from this program, so who knows what I will be doing when I finish my program. </p>
