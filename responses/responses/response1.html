				<h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
				<div class= "handmadetype">The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.</div>

				<div class= "handmadetype2"> I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.</p>

				<div class= "handmadetype3"> Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define the web of this period.</div>

				<div class="handmadetype4"> I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies. </div>
